#### 1.Introduction:
In XTDrone, we provide some tested Operating System images, like Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with ROS Melodic, px4 1.11, XTDrone and so on.</br>
We hope to save developers' time for preparing simulation environment, so you can focus on your own work.</br>
At now, we store these files in Baidu Netdisk, all users can access these resources. Sometimes the Baidu Netdisk's link may have some problem, just raise an issue and we will update them as soon as possible.</br>
